# process model
 - parent processes must wait for their children to exit
 - if a child processes loses its parent, it is orphaned
 - if an orphaned process exits, it becomes a zombie

 - in linux, PID 1 is init (upstart/sysV/systemd)
 - init is responsible for reaping zombie processes
 - PID namespace means containers don't have host init

 - Container defines its own PID 1/init (ENTRYPOINT/CMD)
 - make sure you take care of your children
 - or use Tini
   - also handles signals and other PID 1 responibilities
