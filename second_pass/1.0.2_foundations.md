# virtual machine (1966)
 - full machine "emulated" in software
 - may be hardware assisted (2005) or paravirtualized
 - slice out memory and cpu shares
 - host has no insight into guest OS
# chroot (1979)
 - virtualized file system
 - allows specific libraries to be used
 - can still see what the host is doing
# bsd jails (2000)
 - similar to chroot
 - virtualized files, processes, users, and superusers (similar to namespaces)
 - separated from other jails
# kernel namespaces (2002;2006)
 - mnt, pid, net, ipc, user, cgroup
 - mount, process, network, interprocess communication, user, control group
 - isolates and virtualizes these resources for a process
# LXC (2008)
 - uses namespaces and control groups to provide isolation
# unionFS (1993;2014)
 - I(nheriting)FS (1993), UnionFS (??), AUFS (2006), OverlayFS (2009; 2014)
 - base layer + change layers = final file system
