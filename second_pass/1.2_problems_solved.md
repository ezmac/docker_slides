# What problems does it solve?

 - use server resources more efficiently
 - disposable "linux" for experiments
 - immutable infrastructure
 - isolate software versions on same host
 - drop unnecessary privileges
 - applications need no knowledge of host
 - applications can be moved around a cluster
 - faster deployment by shipping file system blobs
 - remove unnecessary files visible by processes
and more!



## my notes

Think of it all from the venue of running services and applications for customers

 - isolation
   - with chroot, you can build up a file system to run specific versions of an application
     - host ports are still an issue
     - process isolation is an issue
   - limit memory consumption so a memory leak in one app won't harm all other apps

 - some security mitigation
   - not complete solution but can drop abilites like kill, chown, net_bind, etc
   - can also prevent a compromise from spreading to other applications through isolation
 - speeding deployment
   - in build step, dependencies are fetched and an image is built
   - deploying image is as fast as you can shuttle bits
   - replacement is easy because new host port can be bound without releasing old one
 - reproducability
   - images are unchanging; once built, you can remove a large chunk of possible change
