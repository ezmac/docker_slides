# What does it do?
Provides
 - isolation
   - uses kernel namespaces
   - gives containers limited view of host
   - ensures resource limits are respected
 - portability
   - file system ships as tar of layers
   - runs wherever docker engine runs
 - ease of use
   - combines 
     - namespaces
     - cgroups
     - layered file systems
     - capabilities
 - lower overhead (than vms)
   - layered file systems can be shared
   - single kernel
   - no emulation


## my notes
TODO: maybe rewrite

 - portability
   - a dockerized application will run on any host capable of running docker (linux vs windows)
 - isolation
   - containers have a limited view of the host
   - host resources may be virtualized to the container
 - ease of use
   - docker is built on linux kernel primitives (namespaces and cgroups)
   - you can use them to acheive the same thing but docker is easier
 - lower overhead
   - compared to a VM, docker is faster and smaller in both memory and disk
