# Docker talk for iwp: an outline of sorts
Background: Something is very deeply wrong with me and I want to give talks and help other people use cool tools. This means that after attending an IWP meeting, I went up to the organizer and told him I could give a talk.  Normally, I would duck out the back door when no one was looking.  I mean, I did that, but after, I went back and volunteered.

## Docker: Good, Bad, and Ugly; pick 2.

## I'm not particularly fond of presentation tools
So this talk is given in vim and shell.
You're welcome to give your own talk if you think those are not appropriate tools for a talk.











## Development branch has 3 half baked versions of this talk



## yes, I'm aware of lxc and jails.
Docker isn't perfect, that's cool.  I'm not either.

## You mix the markdown and .md extensions
yep. See slides.sh for why
