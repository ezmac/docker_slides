## Volumes vs Bind mounts
 - Bind mounts use your file system directly
   - Direct
   - Easy to manage with traditional tools

 - Volumes stored in docker area of file system
   - Indirect
   - "Easy" to manage with docker
   - *allows volume drivers*
   - sharing rw for multiple containers


## -v vs --mount

 - `--mount` preferred (by docker) because it is "simpler"

 - `-v source:container_path[:ro_rw_mode]` #rw is default mode
     - `-v /host/path:/container/path:ro`  # bind mount, read only (ex. 1)
     - `-v volume_name:/container/path` # volume without mode, read write (ex. 2)
 - Order is important


 - `--mount source=source,destination=container_path[,type=volume,bind,tmpfs][readonly]`
     - `--mount src=/host/path,dst=/container/path,type=bind,readonly`  # bind mount, read only (ex. 1)
     - `--mount src=volume_name,dst=/container/path`  # volume without mode, read write (ex. 2)
 - Order is NOT important
 - Do not use spaces
