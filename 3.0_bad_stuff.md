# Bad parts of docker


 - hub.docker.com got hacked a couple weeks ago

 - backwards compatability
 - invisibility inside container (vuln scanning, patching, etc)
 - throw out traditional tools
 - immutability means no patching
   - rebuild/replace only
 -  it's still Linux
   - file permissions/users
   - process model
   - init
 - secrets
   - not supported unless you're on swarm

 - when bind mounting, you can mess up files on host
   - bad ownership
   - deleting them entirely
 - container escapes are still possible
 - get ready to learn a lot of linux (is that really a bad thing?)
 - Did you notice how we just ignore huge parts of it?
   - seriously who uses swarm in production?
 - Docker on rhel..  is that a thing?
 - Do you even file system?
   - btrfs, aufs, overlay, overlay2, zfs?
 - kernel minimums
 - rebuild servers constantly
 - Even stable is bleeding edge
   - Date check everything

 - engine runs as root
   - oh exploitable


## My notes
You know how sometimes you get rushed on a project and you have to cut corners? then people demand new features but you can't take time to rewrite?
And it's in use, so you can't go back and change it?

Also, it's your company's enterprise solution?  yah, that's docker
