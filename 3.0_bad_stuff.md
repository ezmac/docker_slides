# Bad parts of docker

- Bind mounts on OSX are terribly slow
   - Fsnotify may not work correctly
   - they're still working on it
- Building images on Windows is terribly slow
- Docker is still primarily for Linux
- Public docker base images can have tons of vulnerabilities
   - up to you to patch constantly
- It's still "bleeding edge" and moving fast
   - date check everything you read
- Security tools haven't caught up yet
- Many approaches to using it; no consensus on correct way
- Suffering from success


## My notes
You know how sometimes you get rushed on a project and you have to cut corners? then people demand new features but you can't take time to rewrite?
And it's in use, so you can't go back and change it?

Also, it's your company's enterprise solution?  yah, that's docker
