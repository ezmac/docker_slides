# What does it actually do?
 - isolation
   - limited view of host
   - can enforce resource limits
 - ease of use
   - built on namespaces, union file systems, chroot, cgroups, capabilities, etc
   - greater than the sum of its parts
 - portability
   - container runs wherever docker engine runs *
   - image packages everything but the kernel
 - lower overhead **
   - shared OS kernel
   - no emulation
 - better shipping (deploys)
   - install packages at build time
   - ship layers as tarballs







## caveat
 - * containers are os and architecture specific; containers built for docker/arm64 won't work on docker/amd64. Some config options may limit portability.  These are exceptions though.
 - ** Lower overhead compared to virtual machines.  Network performance is dependent on configuration but can reach native speed.
