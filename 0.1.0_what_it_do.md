# What does it actually do?

 - Isolation
   - Limited view of host
   - Can enforce resource limits
 - Ease of use
   - Built on namespaces, union file systems, chroot, cgroups, capabilities, etc
   - Greater than the sum of its parts
 - Portability
   - Container runs wherever docker engine runs *
   - Image packages everything but the kernel
 - Lower overhead **
   - Shared OS kernel
   - No emulation
 - Better shipping (deploys)
   - Install packages at build time
   - Ship layers as tarballs







## caveat
 - * containers are os and architecture specific; containers built for docker/arm64 won't work on docker/amd64. Some config options may limit portability.  These are exceptions though.
 - ** Lower overhead compared to virtual machines.  Network performance is dependent on configuration but can reach native speed.
