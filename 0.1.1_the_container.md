# Containers in 2 minutes:

 - packaged unit of software
 - with os assisted isolation


   Docker containers consists of:
   - Image
     - root filesystem (base image + changes)
   - standard set of instruction
     - used to build image and run a container
   - execution environment (engine)
     - configuration of host/container
     - manages running containers


## My notes:
Think of chroot or a virtual machine; containers are somewhere between.
Docker did not invent containers, but it did popularize them.
