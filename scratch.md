When the universe was created, Jan 1 1970, Unix was still in development by the minor deities Sir Dennis M Ritchie and (deserves an honorific) Ken Thompson.  It's release to the public in 1973 forever changed the life of a young Linus Torvalds who would forever make computer nerds argue over complicated licensing models they don't fully understand.  By the time Torvalds released linux in 1991, Unix had been on the decline due, in part, to its high cost for home users, but the unix philosophy lived on in Linux.  In modern society, no one important uses unix. (OSX is a certified Unix, but who cares).  But this is not a talk on Unix.  Mainly because 40 minutes is not nearly long enough to explain the beauty of the unix philosophy.  This is about docker, which means it's about Linux.  If you know unix or solaris, just.. like.. hold your tongue, I know solaris jails are great, but find me a cloud provider who offers a solaris machine image.  Moving on.
In March 2013 at v0.9 Solomon Hykes Micdropped docker at Pycon to much fanfare.  In September, it had support from Redhat for use in RHEL and OpenShift.  In November 2014, Docker support was added to AWS EC2 in the form of ECS.  In December, IBM wanted some docker for their cloud.
### Key takeaways
From zero to Redhat in 6 months is huge.
From zero to AWS building an entire service around your tool in 13 months is massive.
