# ENTRYPOINT vs CMD
 Explain problem; quote form vs array form; explain relation

 - Need at least one
 - Most base containers define an entrypoint
 - two forms
   - avoid "quote form"
   - use ["array", "form"]
 - cmd will be appended to entrypoint (if using array form)
 - entrypoint should match container purpose

## TODO: Copy the table in here.
   rewrite to suit
