# Networking
docker run `--link other_container`

 - docker can link containers over "network"
 - /etc/hosts used for DNS resolution
 - traffic is internal to the "network"

docker run `-p 8008:80`
 - expose container port 80 on host port 8008
 - gets weird on not linux because "host" is a virtual machine

## TODO maybe demo here?
