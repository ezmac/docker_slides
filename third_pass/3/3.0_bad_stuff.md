# Bad parts of docker
 - hub.docker.com got hacked a couple weeks ago

 - when bind mounting, you can mess up your local files
   - bad ownership
   - deleting them entirely
 - container escapes are still possible
 - get ready to learn a lot of linux
 - immutability means no patching
   - rebuild/replace only
 - runs as root.
   - oh exploitable


## DEMO TIME!!!
 - sudo ls /etc/sudoers.d/
 - cat "fail" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/fail
 - sudo ls /etc/sudoers.d/
   - ## OH NOES!
 - docker run -it -v /etc/sudoers/:/data ubuntu rm /data/fail
 - sudo ls /etc/sudoers.d/
   - ## it's back!
