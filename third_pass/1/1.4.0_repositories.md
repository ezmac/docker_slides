# Docker hub and repositories
 - repositories are a central store for images
 - hub.docker.com (public)
 - DTR can be deployed for a private trusted repository
 - AWS ECR
 - specify repository in container name
   - may need to add tags before pushing
     `docker tag source_image[:tag] repository/target_image[:tag]`
 - use `docker push repo/image_name:tag` and `docker pull repo/image_name:tag`
