# Volumes/Bind Mount

## Volumes vs Bind mounts
 - bind mounts use your file system directly
   - direct
   - easy to manage with traditional tools

 - volumes stored in docker area of file system
   - indirect
   - "easy" to manage with docker
   - *allow volume drivers*


## volume vs mount

 - `--mount` preferred (by docker) because it is "simpler"

 - `-v source:container_path[:ro_rw_mode]` #rw is default mode
     - `-v /host/path:/container/path:ro`  # bind mount, read only (ex. 1)
     - `-v volume_name:/container/path` # volume without mode, read write (ex. 2)
 - order is important

 - `--mount source=source,destination=container_path[,type=volume,bind,tmpfs][readonly]`
     - `--mount src=/host/path,dst=/container/path,type=bind,readonly`  # bind mount, read only (ex. 1)
     - `--mount src=volume_name,dst=/container/path`  # volume without mode, read write (ex. 2)
 - order is NOT important
 - do not use spaces

## my notes

 - there is a difference between volumes and bind mounts
   - history; volumes are opaque, bind mounts are transparent.
     - "volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts"
     - hah, no they're not.
       - `docker run --rm --volumes-from dbstore -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /dbdata` # docker recommended way to backup a volume. Notice that it uses a bind mount?
       - `tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /dbdata` #create backup when using a bind mount.
     - benefit for volumes when using volume drivers

 - shares files at runtime instead of build time
 - useful to abstract away storage type (nfs, etc)
 - run immutable container with data volume
 - tmpfs mounts memory as storage

 - #demo2_1 - ls /root/ with no volumes
 - #demo2_2 - ls /root/ with pwd as volume
 - #demo2_3 - touch file in /root/, ls pwd
