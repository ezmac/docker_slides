# Volume mounts

 docker run `-v /host/path:/container/path:rX`

 - shares files at runtime instead of build time
   - where rX is rw or ro; also optional, defaults to rw
 - useful to abstract away storage type (nfs, etc)
 - run immutable container with data volume
 - share application source into running container for development


## my notes
 - #demo2_1 - ls /root/ with no volumes
 - #demo2_2 - ls /root/ with pwd as volume
 - #demo2_3 - touch file in /root/, ls pwd
