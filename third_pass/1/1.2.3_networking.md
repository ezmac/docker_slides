# Networking
docker run `-p 8008:80`
 - expose container port 80 on host port 8008
 - gets weird on not linux because "host" is a virtual machine

docker run `--link other_container`
 - docker can link containers over "network"
 - /etc/hosts used for DNS resolution
 - traffic is internal to the "network"


## my notes
 - #demo3_1 - runs httpd in background port mapped to localhost:8000
 - #demo3_2 - curl localhost:8000
