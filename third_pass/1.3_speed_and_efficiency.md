# Speed
 - containers add some overhead (est 3% loss)
 - Shared kernel
 - Shared "filesytem base"
   - no copying to run second container on the same machine
 - no package manager (if done at build)
 - deploys in seconds (if built correctly)










## My notes
Kernel primitives are said to add some small overhead, commonly thought to be about 3%.  Container layers significantly smaller to copy than VM; shared kernel reduces overhead of running VM switches.  If deploying many identical containers, no copy of images after the first.  If you build the container with packages installed, no waiting for installation.  Once layers exist on host, it's as fast as your app to start.
