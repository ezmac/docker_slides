# What problems does it solve?

Docker provides a clean contract with the underlying operating system

 - Efficient use of host resources
 - Immutable infrastructure
 - Software isolation
 - Dev/Test/Prod parity
 - Scaling






## my notes

 - disposable "linux" for experiments
 - 12factor.net can be achieved using docker

Docker provides a clean contract with the underlying operating system
 - applications need no knowledge of host
 - applications can be moved around a cluster
