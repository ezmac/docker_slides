# Who uses Docker?


## Big names:
 - Google
 - Amazon
 - Uber
 - Lyft
 - Twitter
 - Apple
 - Netflix
 - Cornell University # We got a feature [1]


## my notes:


talking points:
 - docker is mainstream
 - usage is growing
 - cloud scale and small operations both

 - Big names may not use docker in the same capacity that smaller outfits may, but many open source projects released by them support docker out of the box.
