 - recent history is less interesting


















## my notes:

 - docker is only about 5 years old.
 - announced at pycon in 2013
 - Quickly adopted by the industry
 - GA release in 2014; about 1 year after public announcement
 - AWS product released in less than 2 years
 - Docker is still progressing, but not in ways that are interesting for this talk
