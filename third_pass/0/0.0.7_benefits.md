# Benefits

## my notes:
  Transition: from previous: Why all the hype around docker?  Because it has some serious benefits

  These are dependent on how you use it and what your setup is, but many orgs can see these by adopting docker


## What it do is an explanation of how it works.
## Problems solved is unconventional applications of docker
## Benefits is why people use it or want it
# TODO: consider this might not be great since you have problems solved, what it do, etc.
