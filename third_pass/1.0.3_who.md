# Who uses Docker?
In short, everyone.

## Big names:
 - Facebook
 - Apple
 - Amazon
 - Netflix
 - Google
 - Twitter
 - Lyft
 - Uber
 - Cornell University


## My notes:
 - Big names may not use docker in the same capacity that smaller outfits may, but many open source projects released by them support docker out of the box.
