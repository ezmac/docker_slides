# Packaging/portability

 - Image
   - provides everything but kernel
   - OS dependencies managed in the container
 - Filesystems
   - software installed at build time
   - layered by changes to base image
   - transferred as multiple compressed binary blob
 - engine configures necessary host resources for container
   - container needs no knowledge of host
 - Repository
   - central storage for images










## my notes
 - a docker image is everything above the kernel
   - all dependencies are in the container
 - the image provides a file system using a union filesystem
   - this is the base image plus a layer for each change
 - the engine is what takes care of setting up namespaces, file systems, mappings, capabilities, resource limits, etc.
   - because the engine and container are both standard, you can run a docker container anywhere there is a docker engine
