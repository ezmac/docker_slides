# Lower overhead
 - containers can reach native performance
 - Shared kernel
 - Shared "filesytem base"
   - no copying to run second container on the same machine
 - network performance can be native

## my notes
Containers are fast.  They're close to or actually native.
Shared kernel means less memory used
  Also means host has more info about used memory and can manage it better
layers may be shared between images, reducing disk usage and transfer
layers can be shared between running containers
full network devices can be shared into containers for increased performance

## TODO
 - find more benchmarks backing this up.
 - is it still necessary to share network device into container for performance?
