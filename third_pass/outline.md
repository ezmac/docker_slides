# how to explain something as complex as docker to people with random skill levels
How many of you are developers?
How many of you are ops?
Any DevOps?


















Gauge interest of people?
 - How many developers?
 - Operators
 - DevOps

Who has ever been burned by "Works on my machine"?
How about "This feature needs version Y but we only have version X"?
How about "Hacker found an exploit in X application and got into Y from there"?

Modern web development is weird.

 - software versions
   - node is concurrently support major versions 8, 10, and 11
 - package managers
   - npm, composer, bundle, yum, apt
 - dependencies
   - musl vs glibc
 - dev/test/prod
 - expected to deploy to multiple times a day
 - majority of servers run linux; minority of developers do
 - full stack?
 - security?!?
   - we don't need any of that /s
 - web scale
 - 5 nines


reorder foundation and history

drop foundation slide and ask if they know namespaces
on 1->2 transition, maybe say something to make the transition less hard

Maybe explain the very specific problems rather than just the solution.

Stop talking about how we just want to use it.
i don't give a crap about how it works

first_pass looks better
split applying docker and expound
