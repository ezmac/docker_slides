# Docker for devops (part deux)

- Git + Jenkins + docker = CI
   - automated npm audit
      - Fail job if `npm audit` fails
   - run tests against container on commit
- Schedule rebuilds and deploys
   - up to date all the time
 - Tag images with build number
   - Rollback means deploying previous build tag
- Scaling
   - Need more capacity? Add a server to the cluster
   - Need more load handling? Start more containers
- Flexible
   - ecs, kubernetes, rancher, docker enterprise
   - you decide the orchestration
