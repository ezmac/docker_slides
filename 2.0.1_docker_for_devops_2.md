# Docker for devops (part deux)

- Git + Jenkins + docker
   - automated npm audit
      - Fail job if `npm audit` fails
- run tests against container pre deploy
   - Fail job if tests fail
- schedule rebuilds and deploys
   - up to date all the time
 - tag images with build number
   - rollback means deploying previous build tag
- scaling
   - need more capacity? Add a server to the cluster
   - need more load handling? Start more containers
- flexible
   - ecs, kubernetes, rancher, docker enterprise
   - you decide the orchestration
