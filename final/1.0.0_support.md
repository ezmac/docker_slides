# Installing
Docker engine releases for:
 - centos
 - debian
 - fedora
 - ubuntu
and others
 - windows ???

Docker Desktop for:
 - macOS
 - windows 10

Follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/install/



## My notes
 - docker engine runs on (probably) any linux
 - official releases for most mainstream distros
 - Docker has Windows containers
 - they only run on Windows
 - I don't have Windows
 - I'm offended that you asked
 - Docker Desktop available on Windows and osx
   - no gui tools for linux ;)
 - installation is well documented
