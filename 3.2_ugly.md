# Ugly

 - hub.docker.com got hacked a couple weeks ago

 - security
   - secrets
     - not supported unless you're on swarm
     - don't build secrets into your container
   - container escapes are still possible
   - vulnerability scanning is a new field
 - backwards compatability
   - docker maintains it's backwards compatability
   - not guaranteed to work with older Linux components
 - it's still Linux
   - and you'll need to know a lot of it.
   - file permissions/users
   - process model
   - init
 - Docker Inc. needs to make money
   - pushing enterprise tools
 - File systems
   - btrfs, aufs, overlay, overlay2, zfs?
   - which one to use depends on your os
 - engine runs as root
   - oh exploitable
