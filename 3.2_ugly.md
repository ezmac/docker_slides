# Ugly

- hub.docker.com got hacked a couple weeks ago

- security
   - Security tools haven't caught up yet
   - secrets
     - not supported unless you're on swarm
     - don't build secrets into your container
   - container escapes are still possible
   - vulnerability scanning is a new field
   - Public docker base images can have tons of vulnerabilities
     - up to you to patch constantly

- backwards compatability
   - Docker is pretty backwards compatible with itself
   - Not with old kernels/Linuxes
- it's still Linux
   - and you'll need to know a lot of it.
   - file permissions/users
   - process model
   - init
- Docker Inc. needs to make money
   - pushing enterprise tools
- File systems
   - btrfs, aufs, overlay, overlay2, zfs?
   - which one to use depends on your os
- engine runs as root
   - oh exploitable

## Demo
 - ./root_exploit.sh
