# Ugly

- hub.docker.com got hacked a couple weeks ago
  - this is fine


- security
   - Security tools haven't caught up yet
   - secrets
     - not supported unless you're on swarm
     - don't build secrets into your container
   - container escapes are still possible
   - vulnerability scanning is a new field
   - Public docker base images can have tons of vulnerabilities
     - up to you to patch constantly
- Docker Inc. needs to make money
