# Linux process model
 - Parent processes must wait for their children to exit
 - If a child processes loses its parent, it is orphaned
 - If an orphaned process exits, it becomes a zombie

 - In Linux, PID 1 is init (upstart/sysV/systemd)
 - Init is responsible for reaping zombie processes
 - PID namespace means containers don't have host init

 - Container defines its own PID 1/init (ENTRYPOINT/CMD)
 - Make sure you take care of your children
 - Or use Tini
   - also handles signals and other PID 1 responibilities
