# Docker for devops

 - I work in an ECS heavy shop
 - some cool stuff we use docker for:

   - Git + Jenkins = docker build/deploy on commit
     - Build image/push to ECR
     - Start new container
     - Ensure healthy
     - Load Balancer sends traffic to new container
     - Old container stopped
   - Test/Prod parity
     - difference is in configuration
       - config pulled on container start
     - Test tracks development branch
     - merge to master deploys to prod
   - Run sftp servers
     - https://github.com/atmoz/sftp
     - bind mount for persistance and keys
     - configured through environment
   - No patching
     - rebuild containers frequently
     - replace cluster for updates
