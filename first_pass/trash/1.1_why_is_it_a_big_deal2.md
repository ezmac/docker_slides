# Kind of a big deal
 - isolation is through well defined kernel level primitives
 - packaging solved through layers of file system snapshots and isolation
 - speed/lightweight
   - all containers share the same OS kernel
   - some level of resource sharing for similar containers
 - Application PACKing (efficient use of server resources)






## my notes 

Docker solves a couple of old problems and some new ones.
 - works on my machine
 - *env or *vm
 - time to deploy
 - multi-homing apps
 - isolation
