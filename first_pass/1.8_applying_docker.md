# Core principles:
 - one task per container
 - composable containers
 - host to container mappings
 - ephemerality

# Problems where Docker is well-suited
 - Web servers
 - stateless applications
 - short lived tasks

# When you should not use docker:
 - Docker has a large learning overhead
   - when compared to doing nothing
 - Docker through a VM can be painful
 - Developing purely in docker can suck if you're not native Linux (small files issue)
 - if you need tight coupling of many services
   - (possibly a design issue)
   - All hail the monolith


## My notes
I don't subscribe to one process per container. You can run cron and a webserver in one container, but the consensus is against that.
