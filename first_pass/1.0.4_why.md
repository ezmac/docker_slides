# Why is docker a thing
Docker comes from the "Platform as a Service" tech area
It features:
 - isolation
 - portability
 - low overhead
 - ease of use

Think of it like, you're hosting apps for 100 companies.

## my notes
To understand docker, look at it from the perspective of a hosting provider.  You make more money by having more customers and fewer servers/work hours.  That benefits the ops side in the same way; fewer servers, less time messing with them.
