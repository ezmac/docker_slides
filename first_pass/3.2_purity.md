# Avoid polluting your system
## Three examples
###  I needed kerberos tools
 - didn't want to install kerberos server..
 - Fresh docker with volume mounts
### GlibC
 - during wheezy to squeeze (squeezy) major glibc change
 - didn't want to reboot, so ran modern tools in docker
### I hate java and have built containers just to not have it installed.
