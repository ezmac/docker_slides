# Efficient co-hosting

Cgroups can limit host resource usage
 - restrict max memory and cpu
   - soft/hard allows for bursting without breaking other containers
Mapping container resources to host resources:
 - host volume mappings
   - nfs
 - port assignment
   - each container can bind it's own port 80
Faster deploys because layers may already exist
Easier replacement because less resource contention





## My notes
When hosting many applications on the same box, resource contention is a concern. If apps all want port 80, only one can have it.  Application should not need to know how to do NFS.  If deploying 100 node applications, no need to copy node binary 100 times.
