# Meat:
So how do you start with docker?

Hub! There are so many container builders out there that it's like npm!  Most likely, you'll want to learn the cli before moving onto compose.  Demo time.





## My notes:
Still need to focus on the big 2 aspects of using docker. third of orchestration.

## TODO 
still need a better run example; at least fix the path for nginx
