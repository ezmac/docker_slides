# Packaging
 - Filesystems
   - Union and layering
   - Snapshotting











## My notes
Isolation is needed to keep one customer from affecting others.  From an ops POV, this is not security, but it can be a part of it. PID and network isolation keep running containers from knowing what other containers are doing.  Cgroups allow restricting resource usage.  Filesystems prevent reading other containers files (unless you want htat), and dropping caps removes some risk of abusing capabilites to escape
