# Using Docker
 - as a developer
   - running applications in containers
   - building containers
 - as an ops or devops engineer
   - building containers
   - orchestrating




## my notes
You need to talk about why you're using it..
if you're a developer, the problems you solve will be much different than an ops person will have.

Ops people will need to consider more deeply how docker works than developers

We'll start with the developer point of view since ops roles will need it and more.
