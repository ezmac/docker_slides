# ENTRYPOINT vs CMD
 - `["exec", "form"]`
 - `"shell form"`
 - Don't use shell form
 - ENTRYPOINT is the main command for the image
   - Usually set by base image; ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
 - CMD will be appended to entrypoint (if using exec form)
 - CMD is good for most purposes
 - ENTRYPOINT for advanced usage
