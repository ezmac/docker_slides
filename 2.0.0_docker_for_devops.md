# Docker for devops

- Test/Prod parity
   - development branch = test environment
   - master branch = prod
   - secrets/config pulled on container start
- Git + Jenkins = Continuous Deployment
   - Any fail in pipeline aborts deploy
   - Build image/push to ECR
   - Trigger ECS deploy -> start new container
   - New container registers with Load balancer when healthy
   - Old container stops
   - Side effect: one click re-deploy through Jenkins
- Run sftp servers
   - https://github.com/atmoz/sftp
   - bind mount for persistance and keys
   - configured through environment
   - less risk of breaking server through automation
