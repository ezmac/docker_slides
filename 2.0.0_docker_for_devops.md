# Docker for devops

 - Test/Prod parity
   - config pulled on container start
   - git branch for test/prod deploy
 - Git + Jenkins = Automated deploy
   - Build image/push to ECR
   - use ELB and ECS container replacement for safe deploy
   - side effect: one click re-deploy through Jenkins
 - Run sftp servers
   - https://github.com/atmoz/sftp
   - bind mount for persistance and keys
   - configured through environment
   - less risk of breaking server through automation
