# More Ugly

- it's still Linux
   - file permissions/users
     - user namespace
   - process model
     - look up the docker zombie problem
     - init
- backwards compatability
   - Docker is pretty backwards compatible with itself
   - Not with old kernels/Linuxes
- File systems
   - btrfs, aufs, overlay, overlay2, zfs?
- engine runs as root
   - oh exploitable

## Demo
 - ./root_exploit.sh
