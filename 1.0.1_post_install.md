# Post install
 - Linux
   - docker listens on /var/run/docker.sock
   - docker.sock group owned by docker
   - add yourself to this group; relog to apply group changes
 - macOS
   - Docker Desktop should handle config for you
 - Windows
   - you can switch between windows and linux containers
   - sorry, you're on your own.

## my notes
 - On linux, docker listens on a socket file that's group owned by docker
 - after install, add yourself to the docker group.
   - you need a new login for group changes to take effect.
   - or, you can sudo chown the socket as a temporary fix.  service restarts will undo this.
   - try to not sudo docker.
 - OSX and Windows are on your own.
